  "armagnac": {
    "sourcing_tips": [
      "Buy a genuine Armagnac (not sweetened or flavored brandy). For most cooking uses a younger VS or VSOP is fine; save XO or vintage bottles for finishing or sipping if you’ll taste the spirit in the finished dish.",
      "Look for 40% ABV or higher and, if you care about nuance, note the terroir—Bas‑Armagnac is typically rounder and fruity, Ténarèze a bit more robust—so choose a style that complements your dish."
    ],
    "pairing_tips": [
      "Pairs beautifully with rich meats (duck, pork, veal, game) and foie gras—use it in pan sauces, glazes or marinades to add depth.",
      "Great with fruits and sweets: pears, apples, figs, prunes, dark chocolate, vanilla and caramel desserts; excellent for macerating dried fruit for cakes and tarts.",
      "Works well with creamy and savory partners—butter, cream, mustard, honey, balsamic or reduced red wine—to round and lift both sweet and savory sauces."
    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "Add Armagnac near the end of cooking to preserve its aromatic top notes; a short reduction concentrates flavor, but prolonged boiling will dissipate delicate esters.",
      "When flambéing, warm the spirit slightly, remove the pan from the heat before adding it (or pour into a ladle), ignite with a long match, then return to the stove only after the flame dies down; never ignite directly from the bottle.",
      "Use sparingly—1–2 tablespoons go a long way. Macerate dried fruit for 30 minutes to overnight, stir a spoonful into finishing butter or cream, or deglaze a pan with it to capture the fond."

  "asiago cheese": {
    "sourcing_tips": [
      "Know which style you want: Asiago fresco (young, mild, moist — good for melting) vs. Asiago d'allevo (aged, firm, granular, sharp — best for grating/finishing).",
      "Buy a wedge or whole piece rather than pre-shredded for better flavor and texture; check for a clean, nutty aroma and avoid any sour or ammonia smells."
    ],
    "pairing_tips": [
      "Aged Asiago pairs beautifully with honey, figs or pears and toasted nuts (walnut, almond) — use on a cheese board or shaved over fruit salads.",
      "Match with savory items like prosciutto, salami, olives and crusty bread; use fresher Asiago with mild greens and soft sandwiches.",
      "Wine/beer pairings: aged Asiago with medium‑to‑full reds (Barbera, Chianti) or malty amber ales; fresco suits crisp whites (Pinot Grigio) or light lagers."
    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "Use Asiago fresco for melting applications — grilled cheese, creamy sauces, risotto — because it melts smoothly; stir in off the heat for a silkier finish.",
      "Use aged Asiago for grating or shaving as a finishing cheese: microplane or fine grater releases its nutty, sharp flavor without needing to melt it.",
      "When melting slices (sandwiches, broiled toppings), moderate heat prevents oiling out and burning; for storage, wrap in parchment/wax paper then a loose plastic wrap to prevent drying."

  "achiote": {
    "sourcing_tips": [
      "Buy whole annatto (achiote) seeds when possible — they keep longest and let you control intensity; buy paste/recado rojo if you want a ready-to-use marinade.",
      "Look for a vivid red–orange color and a clean, slightly peppery aroma; avoid faded, musty- or rancid-smelling packages."
    ],
    "pairing_tips": [
      "Pair achiote with bright acids (orange, lime, vinegar), garlic, cumin and oregano to lift its earthy, peppery notes.",
      "Use with pork, chicken, fish/shrimp, root vegetables, rice and beans or coconut-milk stews — it’s excellent as both color and savory backbone.",
      "Combine with fats (oil, lard, butter) to release and carry its pigment and flavor; balance with a little heat (chilies) or acid for contrast."
    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "Bloom seeds or paste in warm oil or fat for 30–60 seconds (don’t let it burn) to extract bright color — then strain the oil for marinades or frying.",
      "Make a fresh recado by toasting and grinding seeds (or using paste) with garlic, cumin, oregano and citrus or vinegar; refrigerate short-term or freeze in portions.",
      "Use sparingly since achiote is primarily a strong coloring agent with a mild earthy note — a small amount goes a long way; store airtight, dark, cool to preserve color."

  "acorn squash": {
    "sourcing_tips": [
      "Choose acorn squash that feels heavy for its size with firm, unbroken skin; avoid soft spots, cracks or mold.",
      "Look for a mostly dark green, matte rind with an intact stem — small orange patches are normal; excessively glossy skin can indicate underripeness or poor storage."
    ],
    "pairing_tips": [
      "Sweet finishes: brown sugar, maple syrup, butter or warm spices (cinnamon, nutmeg) — bacon or maple-bacon makes a great sweet‑savory contrast.",
      "Savory pairings: sage, thyme, rosemary, miso or soy, Parmesan or tangy cheeses (goat, feta), and crunchy elements like toasted pepitas or chopped pecans.",
      "Use as a vehicle for grains and legumes — stuff with quinoa, farro, lentils or beans and brighten with citrus zest, fresh herbs or a vinegar-based dressing."

    "cooking_tips": [
      "Roast halves: halve, scoop seeds, brush with oil and salt, roast cut‑side down at 200–220°C (400–425°F) for ~30–45 minutes until tender; flip cut‑side up and roast briefly to caramelize.",
      "Cut into uniform wedges for quicker, even roasting; spread in a single layer so edges brown and get crisp.",
      "Save and toast the seeds. The skin becomes tender when roasted so you can eat it; scoop roasted flesh for mashes, soups or stuffing and finish on the stove with butter/olive oil and aromatics for best flavor."

  "aioli": {
    "sourcing_tips": [
      "Use a good-quality extra-virgin olive oil for flavor, but if its fruitiness or pepperiness is strong, plan to blend it 1:1 with a neutral oil (grapeseed, light olive, or sunflower) so the aioli isn’t bitter or overpowering.",
      "Choose fresh garlic (plump cloves, no green shoots) and fresh eggs — if you’re worried about raw eggs, buy pasteurized eggs or pasteurized egg yolks."
    ],
    "pairing_tips": [
      "Aioli shines with seafood (grilled fish, shrimp, calamari), roasted or fried potatoes, grilled vegetables, sandwiches and burgers, or as a dip for crudités and bread.",
      "Cut the richness with bright acids and herbs — lemon juice or sherry vinegar, plus parsley, chives, or tarragon — to keep it lively on the palate.",
      "Build flavor contrasts: add smoked paprika, chipotle, harissa or roasted garlic for smoky/spicy notes, or saffron/anchovy for umami depth."
    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "For a stable emulsion use room-temperature yolks, start whisking them with a little acid (lemon or vinegar), then add oil in a very thin steady stream while whisking (or use an immersion blender/food processor for faster, more foolproof results).",
      "If the aioli splits, rescue it by starting a fresh egg yolk in a bowl and very slowly whisking the broken aioli into it, or whisk in a teaspoon of warm water and continue slowly adding the rest of the mixture.",
      "Store aioli in an airtight container in the fridge and use within 3–4 days; always follow safe-egg guidance (use pasteurized eggs or avoid serving to pregnant/immunocompromised people unless eggs were pasteurized or cooked)."

  "allspice": {
    "sourcing_tips": [
      "Prefer whole, dried allspice berries over pre-ground — whole berries retain volatile oils and flavor much longer and you can grind to order.",
      "Choose berries that are glossy, dark brown and fragrant; avoid dusty, pale or broken berries. Store whole in an airtight container away from heat and light (whole keeps 2–3 years; ground loses potency in ~6 months)."
    ],
    "pairing_tips": [
      "Combine with other warm spices (cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, cardamom, black pepper) for baked goods, mulled drinks or holiday baking.",
      "Use with savory proteins and dishes — pork, lamb, beef, game, chicken, beans, tomatoes and Caribbean/Middle Eastern spice blends (jerk, baharat).",
      "Works well in sweet–savory bridges: apples, pears, pumpkin, molasses, chocolate, citrus (especially orange) and rum or brandy."
    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "Toast whole berries briefly in a dry skillet to release essential oils, then grind (mortar & pestle or spice grinder). Grind coarse for rubs, fine for baking.",
      "Bloom ground allspice in hot fat (butter or oil) or warm liquid for 30–60 seconds to amplify aroma. Add early in long braises to meld into the dish or add near the end for a brighter top note.",
      "Use sparingly — allspice is potent. As a guideline: 1/4–1/2 tsp ground allspice for a standard cake or loaf; 4–6 whole berries per liter when infusing liquids, brines or pickles. Adjust to taste."
    ]
  },
  "allspice or cinnamon": {
    "sourcing_tips": [
      "Buy whole whenever possible: whole allspice berries and cinnamon sticks (quills) keep their oils and fragrance far longer than preground; look for glossy, hard allspice berries (no cracks or shriveling).",
      "Know your cinnamon: Ceylon (true cinnamon) is milder, sweeter and delicate; Cassia (common) is bolder and more astringent — choose Ceylon for subtle desserts and Cassia when you want a stronger hit. Buy from a reputable source and check freshness if labeled."
    ],
    "pairing_tips": [
      "Choose by flavor role: pick allspice when you want a peppery, clove‑like warmth (Caribbean jerk, pickles, stews); pick cinnamon for sweet, aromatic notes (baking, tagines, mulled drinks) — both work in sweet and savory contexts.",
      "Combine with other warm spices: cloves, nutmeg, ginger and star anise partner beautifully; both pair with chocolate, dried fruit, apples/pears, pumpkin, root veg, and molasses or brown sugar.",
      "Use fats and acids to balance and carry the spice: butter, cream, olive oil or egg yolks amplify aroma and mouthfeel; a touch of citrus or vinegar brightens and prevents cloying sweetness."
    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "Toast whole spices briefly in a dry pan until fragrant to release essential oils, then grind just before use for freshest flavor.",
      "Use cinnamon sticks and whole allspice for long simmering (stews, mulled liquids) and remove before serving; add ground spices later in cooking (or as a finishing sprinkle) to preserve volatile aromatics.",
      "Substitutions and storage: to mimic 1 tsp allspice, mix 1/2 tsp cinnamon + 1/4 tsp cloves + 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Store airtight in a cool, dark place — ground spices lose potency in ~6 months, whole spices keep 1–2 years."

    "sourcing_tips": [
      "Buy whole, raw or dry‑roasted unsalted almonds for the most versatility and best value; pre‑salted or flavored nuts limit how you can use them and add extra sodium.",
      "Check packaging dates and smell — fresh almonds have a sweet, nutty aroma; store‑bought almond flour or sliced almonds should be in sealed, cool packaging (or kept refrigerated) to avoid rancidity."
    ],
    "pairing_tips": [
      "Pair almonds with citrus, honey or stone fruits and dark chocolate for balanced sweetness and brightness.",
      "Use almonds with rich or creamy ingredients (butter, cream, yogurt, soft cheeses like goat or ricotta) to temper their texture and add silkiness.",
      "Combine almonds with warm spices (cinnamon, cardamom, cumin), fresh herbs (thyme, rosemary) or seeds (sesame) for snacks, salads and roasted vegetables."
    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "Toast almonds briefly in a dry skillet over medium heat, shaking or stirring often until fragrant and lightly browned (2–5 minutes) — cool immediately to stop cooking and avoid a bitter, burnt taste.",
      "To remove skins (for marzipan, blanched flour or a milder flavor), plunge almonds in boiling water for about 60 seconds, drain, cool in cold water and squeeze skins off; pat dry before using.",
      "Grind almonds in small batches for almond flour or crumbs, pulsing rather than running the processor continuously to avoid turning them into butter; for almond milk, soak 8–12 hours, blend with water (about 1:3–1:4 nut:water), then strain through cheesecloth or a nut bag."

  "almonds": {
    "sourcing_tips": [
      "Choose whole, plump, uniform almonds with smooth skins and no dark spots or shriveling—avoid any nuts that look oily or shriveled, which indicate age or rancidity.",
      "Buy in airtight packaging or from high-turnover bulk bins and check the aroma if possible (fresh almonds smell mildly sweet; a painty or sour smell means rancid). Store refrigerated or frozen to extend shelf life; note that many “raw” almonds in some regions are pasteurized—check the label if you need truly raw."
    ],
    "pairing_tips": [
      "Sweet pairings: honey, maple, chocolate, vanilla, citrus zest and stone fruits—use toasted almonds for extra depth.",
      "Savory pairings: rosemary, thyme, smoked paprika, soy/umami elements, cheeses (goat, Parmesan), olives and roasted vegetables—almonds add crunch and richness.",
      "Fat and texture: pair with butter, cream, olive oil or avocado for a silky mouthfeel; use almond flour or milk as a gluten-free or dairy-free base in baking and sauces."
    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "Toast to boost flavor: dry-skillet over medium-low heat for 3–6 minutes or in a 325°F (160°C) oven for 8–12 minutes, shaking or stirring frequently—remove when fragrant and lightly golden to avoid bitterness.",
      "Blanch to remove skins when you need a pale, smooth texture (marzipan, pale almond flour): boil 60–90 seconds, cool in ice water, then slip skins off.",
      "Grind carefully: pulse chilled almonds in short bursts to make flour without turning it into almond butter; store ground almonds or almond flour in the fridge or freezer to prevent oils from going rancid."

  "amaretti cookie crumbs": {
    "sourcing_tips": [
      "Choose amaretti made from real almonds (or almond paste) rather than mostly artificial flavor — check the ingredient list for almonds, sugar and egg whites for cleaner almond flavor.",
      "Pick crisp (hard) amaretti if you plan to crush them into dry crumbs or a crust (they crush more evenly); soft, chewy amaretti work better when you want moister, chunkier texture. Store-bought crumbs should be airtight or freeze leftovers to preserve aroma."
    ],
    "pairing_tips": [
      "Cuts through richness: pair amaretti crumbs with creamy elements — mascarpone, ricotta, panna cotta, custards or gelato — to add crunchy almond-sweet contrast.",
      "Complementary flavors: chocolate (dark or milk), coffee, orange or lemon zest, and stone fruits (peaches, plums) all play nicely with amaretti’s almond-bitter-sweet profile.",
      "Nuts & liqueurs: mix with or sprinkle alongside toasted hazelnuts or pistachios; amaretti and amaretto (or marsala, vin santo) amplify the almond note in desserts and baked goods."
    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "For a durable crust or topping: pulse crumbs to a uniform size, mix with melted butter (and a touch of sugar if needed), press and blind-bake briefly to set — toasting first helps prevent sogginess under moist fillings.",
      "Use crumbs for texture and flavor economy: sprinkle as a finishing crunch on panna cotta, tiramisu, yogurt or roasted fruit, or fold coarse crumbs into cake/biscotti batters for almond pockets.",
      "Toast crumbs lightly in a dry skillet or oven to deepen flavor before using; reserve some larger pieces for contrast. Remember amaretti are sweet — taste and reduce other sugars in the recipe to avoid cloying results."
    ]
  },
  "amaretto": {
    "sourcing_tips": [
      "Choose a reputable brand (Disaronno or a well-reviewed Italian bottler) for a balanced almond/bitter note; very cheap bottles can taste overly syrupy or medicinal.",
      "Check the label for alcohol/sugar content and ingredients—some are made with apricot kernels (similar flavor) rather than almonds, and non‑alcoholic amaretto substitutes are available if you need alcohol‑free or lower‑sugar options."
    ],
    "pairing_tips": [
      "Pairs exceptionally well with coffee or espresso, chocolate, vanilla and cream (mascarpone, ice cream, panna cotta) — use to finish desserts or coffee cocktails.",
      "Bright, acidic fruits and zests (orange, lemon), stone fruits (apricot, peach, pear) and baked fruit compotes play nicely with amaretto’s almond‑like sweetness.",
      "Works with nuts and warm spices — try with almond/hazelnut cakes, frangipane, amaretti cookies, or in custards and warm spice‑spiked glazes."
    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "Add amaretto near the end of cooking or off‑heat to preserve its aromatic top notes; prolonged boiling will dissipate the delicate flavors and concentrate sweetness.",
      "Reduce recipe sugar slightly when adding amaretto (roughly 1–2 tbsp less sugar per 1/4 cup amaretto) since the liqueur is sweet; when substituting for almond extract, remember amaretto is boozy and thinner — start with 1 tbsp amaretto ≈ 1/4–1/2 tsp almond extract plus a touch of sugar.",
      "For sauces or pan deglazing, pour in amaretto, scrape fond, then simmer briefly to meld and mellow; if flambéing, warm off the heat and use caution (typical ABV ~21–28%)."

  "anchovies": {
    "sourcing_tips": [
      "Choose high-quality fillets packed in olive oil or salt-cured in tins from reputable regions (Cantabrian/Spanish or Italian anchoa are prized) — oil-packed fillets are convenient and milder, salt-packed are more intensely flavored.",
      "Check labels for freshness and sustainability (MSC or responsibly sourced), and avoid tins/jars with off odors or very dark, mushy flesh; if very salty, look for products labeled 'desalted' or plan to soak before use."

      "Bright acids (lemon juice, vinegar), bold aromatics (garlic, shallot), and briny ingredients (capers, olives) complement and balance anchovy flavor—think puttanesca, Caesar, or vinaigrettes.",
      "Combine with aged hard cheeses (Parmesan, Pecorino), tomatoes, roasted vegetables, or grilled meats/fish to add depth without tasting overtly 'fishy'."
    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "Let anchovy fillets melt into hot oil early in cooking: chop or press them into the pan with garlic/shallots over medium heat so they dissolve and season the dish rather than remaining as distinct fishy bites.",
      "If anchovies are too salty, rinse briefly or soak in milk/water for 10–30 minutes and pat dry; for oil-packed anchovies, reserve the flavored oil to use in dressings or for sautéing.",
      "Use sparingly and taste as you go—anchovy paste is very concentrated. For textural contrast, quick-fry or roast whole fillets until crisp as a garnish."

  "andouille sausage": {
    "sourcing_tips": [
      "Choose a coarse-ground, smoked andouille from a reputable butcher or brand — Cajun-style andouille is typically coarser and spicier than French varieties and gives more smoke/heat.",
      "Check the label: note whether it’s fully cooked or raw (raw needs thorough cooking), look for natural casing and minimal fillers, and compare sodium/nitrate content if you want a leaner/cleaner option."
    ],
    "pairing_tips": [
      "Use the Cajun 'holy trinity' (onion, celery, bell pepper) plus garlic and tomatoes for classic dishes like gumbo and jambalaya.",
      "Balance the sausage’s smokiness with starches and beans — rice, grits, polenta, potatoes or red beans — or hearty greens like collards or cabbage.",
      "Cut richness with bright or acidic elements (vinegar, lemon, pickles) and finish with fresh herbs (parsley, green onion); pairs well with brown ales or medium-bodied wines."
    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "Sear slices or chunks in a hot skillet (cast iron ideal) to render fat and achieve crisp, browned edges — use the rendered fat to sauté vegetables for extra flavor.",
      "If the andouille is fully cooked/smoked, add it toward the end of long braises or stews to avoid a rubbery texture; raw sausage should be cooked to an internal temperature of 160°F (71°C).",
      "Slice on the bias for more surface area and better browning; score or prick sparingly (too many holes let juices escape and dry the meat)."

    "cooking_tips": [
      "For candied angelica: peel away the tough outer fibers, blanch stems 2–3 times (or simmer briefly) to reduce bitterness, then poach in sugar syrup, dry on a rack and finish by rolling in sugar.",
      "Use small amounts—fresh leaves and young stems are good raw as a subtle herb/garnish; root and seeds are best for infusions, bitters and spirits. Toast seeds lightly before grinding to boost aroma.",

      "Dried: choose plump, evenly colored peas with no moisture, stones or broken pieces — they should be firm and free of wrinkles; buy from a recent turnover batch if possible for best flavor.",
      "Canned/fresh: for convenience pick low‑sodium canned versions (you can always add salt later) or fresh green pods in season (summer) — pods should be bright, firm and not brown or soft."
    ],
    "pairing_tips": [
      "Use smoky, salty proteins (ham hock, bacon, smoked turkey or sausage) or a rich vegetable fat (coconut milk) to round the peas' earthy flavor.",
      "Finish with an acidic or spicy counterpoint — vinegar, lemon, hot sauce or pickled jalapeños — to brighten the dish.",

    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "Soak and timing: black‑eyed peas cook faster than many beans. Quick soak 1–2 hours or no soak but expect 30–60 minutes simmer for dried peas (soaked will be toward the short end); fresh peas take ~10–20 minutes and canned only need to be heated gently.",
      "Flavor base and liquid: cook them in a savory liquid (stock or water with a ham hock, onions, garlic, bay leaf, smoked paprika) and skim foam; add salt early to season the interior — don’t be afraid to season while they cook.",
      "Gentle simmer and finishing acids: simmer gently (not a rolling boil) to keep skins intact. Add acidic ingredients (vinegar, tomatoes, lemon) only at the end to prevent toughening, and finish with fresh herbs or hot sauce for brightness."

      "Pair with salty/umami ingredients (soy sauce, miso, mirin), fatty ingredients (butter, egg yolk, seared fish) or starchy bases (rice, noodles) to round and carry the smoky umami.",
      "Bright or sharp contrasts — grated daikon, scallions, citrus/ponzu — cut richness and highlight the flakes' aroma."
    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "For clear ichiban dashi: heat water with kombu, remove kombu at near‑boil, add bonito flakes, turn off heat, steep ~30s–1 minute, then strain. Avoid boiling after adding the flakes to prevent bitterness. (Rough guide: ~20 g flakes per liter.)",
      "Use very thin flakes as a finishing garnish over hot dishes (okonomiyaki, takoyaki, tofu, steamed rice); the heat makes them 'dance' and releases aroma — add at the end to preserve texture.",
      "Toast briefly to intensify the smoky aroma or grind into a powder/furikake for seasoning; thicker shavings are better for longer infusions, thin shavings for immediate flavor and aroma."

      "Use a mid‑range bourbon for cooking — you want good flavor but don’t need an expensive sipping bottle. Mid‑priced bottles give pronounced vanilla/caramel notes without wasting premium spirit.",
      "Consider the mashbill and proof: wheated bourbons are sweeter and gentler (good for desserts), high‑rye bourbons are spicier (good for savory sauces). Higher proof bottles stand up better to reductions and smoke."
    ],
    "pairing_tips": [
      "Sweet, caramel and nutty ingredients amplify bourbon’s character: brown sugar, maple, molasses, vanilla, pecans and toasted nuts are natural partners.",
      "Bourbon pairs well with rich or smoky proteins — pork (ribs, chops), duck, chicken, brisket and bacon — and with bold condiments like mustard, soy and BBQ flavors.",
      "For desserts and baking, match bourbon with stone fruits (peach, cherry), apples, chocolate, coffee, cream or spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger) to highlight its warmth."

    "cooking_tips": [
      "Revive stale bread by sprinkling or misting with water and heating in a 350°F (175°C) oven for 5–10 minutes to restore crust and soften the crumb; avoid microwaving unless you plan to eat it immediately.",
      "For perfect toasts and grilled sandwiches, brush slices with olive oil or butter and cook over high heat so the Maillard reaction gives a crisp, golden exterior without drying out the interior.",
      "Use imperfect or day‑old loaves deliberately: dry and process into breadcrumbs, cube and toast for croutons, make strata or bread pudding, or soak for panzanella — low oven drying (200°F/95°C) before processing gives best texture."

    ],
    "pairing_tips": [
      "Savory: pair with pork, poultry or game, mushrooms, root vegetables, bacon and leafy greens; herbs like sage, thyme and rosemary and fats (butter, cream) bring out chestnut’s sweet, nutty richness.",
      "Sweet: combine with vanilla, chocolate, orange, maple or honey — chestnut purée works beautifully in cakes, mousses and tarts.",
      "Use chestnuts in stuffing, soups, risottos or purees to add body and a slightly sweet, earthy flavor; they also make a great textural contrast when roasted and tossed into salads."
    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "Always score each chestnut before cooking (a shallow X or slit through the flat side) so steam can escape and peeling is possible. For roasting: 220°C (425°F) for 20–30 minutes, shake pan occasionally; peel while still hot (wrap in a towel to steam/loosen skins).",
      "For soft, spreadable chestnuts or easier peeling, simmer (parboil) for 15–20 minutes after scoring, then peel and finish by roasting or blending into purée. To make purée cook in milk/water with a little sugar or salt, then blend and strain if silky texture is desired.",
      "If using chestnut flour: it’s gluten‑free and very absorbent — replace only part of wheat flour (or add a binder like egg/xanthan) and increase liquid. Peeled chestnuts or purée freeze well; blanch/peel first for easiest storage and thawing."

      "Cold‑soak kombu overnight for a gentle, clean dashi (useful for cold soups or light broths). For vegetarian/vegan dashi, simmer dried shiitake or niboshi gently instead of bonito.",
      "Store fresh dashi in the fridge for 2–3 days or freeze in small portions. Don’t discard used kombu/katsuobushi — simmer again to make niban dashi (a milder second stock) or reduce a batch to a double‑strength concentrate so you can control final seasoning."

      "Serve with starches that stand up to duck fat: roasted or smashed potatoes cooked in duck fat, creamy polenta, or a hearty grain. For wine, lighter reds like Pinot Noir or Gamay work beautifully; fuller reds (Merlot, Syrah) can also pair depending on the sauce."
    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "Render the skin: score the skin (not the meat) in a diamond or parallel pattern, season, and start skin‑side down in a cold skillet or on a rack so the fat renders slowly. Go low-and-slow first to melt fat, then finish over higher heat to crisp the skin. Save the rendered fat for roasting potatoes or vegetables.",
      "Duck breast technique: cook skin-side down until much of the fat is rendered and the skin is deep golden (typically 6–12 minutes depending on thickness), then sear briefly on the flesh side. Aim for about 130–140°F (54–60°C) for medium-rare to medium and rest 5–10 minutes before slicing. (USDA recommends 165°F for poultry safety — use well-sourced meat and avoid cross-contamination if you prefer lower doneness.)",
      "Legs and slow-cooking: legs are ideal for confit or long braises. Cure or season, then cook slowly in fat or a braising liquid until falling-apart tender; finish under a broiler or in a hot pan to crisp the skin. Low-and-slow yields the best, most unctuous texture."

      "Simmer gently (low rolling simmer) until tender so the small beans stay intact — vigorous boiling will break them up. Add salt toward the end of cooking to avoid toughening the skins; if your water is very hard, a single small pinch of baking soda can shorten cooking time but use sparingly.",
      "If using canned flageolets, rinse to remove excess sodium and warm them briefly with aromatics (shallot, herbs, butter/olive oil). In stews or casseroles add cooked flageolets near the end so they hold their shape."

    "cooking_tips": [
      "Grate fresh horseradish just before use (microplane or coarse grater). The volatile compounds that give the bite form when you grate — wear gloves and work in a ventilated area to avoid eye/nose irritation.",
      "To preserve pungency, stir grated root with a little white vinegar immediately after grating (acid stabilizes the heat) or add raw at the end of cooking. To mellow the heat, cook briefly or fold into dairy (cream, butter, sour cream).",
      "Store the peeled root wrapped in a damp paper towel in the fridge for several weeks, or grate and freeze small portions (ice-cube tray with a splash of vinegar or oil) for several months. Prepared horseradish/sauce keeps about 1–2 weeks refrigerated."

      "Soften tubs slightly before serving (5–10 minutes at room temperature) for perfect scoops; for recipes, work with ice cream at the right stage—soft-serve for spreading or scooping, fully hardened for coating or shaping.",
      "When making milkshakes or blended desserts, keep ingredients cold and pulse briefly to avoid melting and a watery result.",
      "If you make custard-based ice cream: cook the custard to about 170–175°F to thicken and pasteurize, cool quickly in an ice bath, age it refrigerated for several hours or overnight, then churn to soft-serve before hardening in the freezer for best texture."

    "cooking_tips": [
      "Cook gently and add late: ice wine’s aromatic top notes are fragile — don’t boil. Add near the end of cooking or reduce over low heat to preserve its perfume.",
      "Reduce to a glaze or syrup for poached fruit, pan sauces, or a drizzle over desserts — a small reduction concentrates flavor without losing acidity.",
      "Use sparingly (and remember the cost): a little goes a long way in sauces, vinaigrettes, or baked-syrups. It also caramelizes quickly because of high sugar—watch the heat."

  "ice wine vinegar": {
    "sourcing_tips": [
      "Buy from a reputable producer and check the label for “ice wine vinegar” (or “Eisweinessig”/“icewine”). It’s usually small‑batch and pricier than common wine vinegars — quality matters for its delicate aroma.",

    "pairing_tips": [
      "Classic sweet pairings: dark chocolate, vanilla, cream, cherries (fresh or preserved), marzipan/amaretto — great in Black Forest cake, chocolate sauces, ice cream and custards.",
      "Savory pairings: pork, duck, and game benefit from a splash in pan sauces or glazes — the cherry-acid note brightens rich meat dishes.",
      "Cocktails & cheese: use in sour-style cocktails or add a small splash to fondue or soft cheeses for extra depth."
    ],

      "Serve with bright or acidic accompaniments (pickles, citrus, lightly dressed greens, ponzu) to cut the rich fat, and a neutral starch (plain steamed rice or simple potatoes) to balance the intensity.",
      "Pair simply: a delicate, low‑tannin red (pinot noir), a clean sake (ginjō/junmai), or a crisp lager/Belgian pale will complement rather than overpower the beef."
    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "Bring to room temperature and pat very dry. Preheat a heavy skillet or grill until very hot, then sear quickly on high heat. For steaks aim for rare–medium‑rare (about 120–130°F / 49–54°C) — overcooking wastes the marble.",
      "Use minimal added fat (the beef renders plenty). Sear each side to develop a crust, tilt the pan and baste gently with rendered fat if desired. Avoid long marinades or heavy sauces that mask the flavor.",
      "After cooking, rest steaks 5–8 minutes, then slice thinly across the grain. For thin‑sliced preparations (shabu/sukiyaki) cook only seconds—just enough to warm and soften the fat to preserve texture and flavor."

    "cooking_tips": [
      "For clear, sweet dashi: wipe kombu with a damp cloth (don’t rinse away the white bloom), soak in cold water 30 minutes–overnight, heat gently to just below boiling (about 60–80°C) and remove before it boils to avoid bitterness or sliminess.",
      "Score, cut or tear kombu to increase surface area for faster extraction. For a stronger stock you can simmer briefly after soaking, but avoid long rolling boils.",
      "Don’t discard used kombu — simmer it with soy/mirin/sugar to make tsukudani, chop into rice or stews, or dry and grind into umami powder. Store unused kombu airtight in a cool, dry place (or freeze) and note its high iodine content if you have thyroid concerns."

      "Use fat and umami to round flavors: olive oil, butter, cheese (Parmesan, Pecorino), pancetta or sausage complement acidic tomato sauces and bitter greens.",
      "Brighten and balance with acid/herbs: a squeeze of lemon, splash of vinegar, or fresh basil/parsley cuts richness and lifts tomato- or cream-based dishes."
    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "Use a large pot of rapidly boiling, well-salted water (about 1–1.5 tbsp salt per 4–6 L/qt). Stir early to prevent sticking and cook to 'al dente'—a minute or two before package time if you’ll finish in the sauce.",
      "Reserve a cup of starchy pasta water before draining. Finish the pasta in the sauce over heat, adding pasta water a little at a time to loosen and create a silky emulsion that helps sauce cling.",

    "cooking_tips": [
      "Ripen underripe peaches at room temperature in a paper bag with an apple or banana; once ripe refrigerate and use within 2–4 days. Handle ripe peaches gently to avoid bruising.",
      "To peel quickly for jams/compotes, score the skin, blanch 20–30 seconds in boiling water and shock in ice water — the skins will slip off. For grilling, halve and pit (no need to peel) and brush cut sides with oil or butter.",
      "Macerate sliced peaches with a bit of sugar and lemon (or liqueur) to draw juices for desserts, or roast/grill over high heat to caramelize sugars — finish with a splash of vinegar, balsamic reduction or liqueur to make a pan sauce."

    "cooking_tips": [
      "Roast or toast to develop depth: oven at about 325–350°F (160–175°C) for 10–20 minutes, stirring once or twice; cool before handling so oils settle and skins loosen.",
      "Use peanut oil for high-heat frying because of its high smoke point; to make smooth peanut butter, process warm roasted peanuts (add a touch of neutral oil and a pinch of salt), and refrigerate to slow oil separation and rancidity.",
      "Remove skins by blanching 1–2 minutes in boiling water then cooling and rubbing, or roast and rub between towels while warm. And always clearly label/advise when serving — peanut allergy is common and serious."

      "Choose whole‑milk or 'whole' ricotta for the creamiest texture; part‑skim if you want lower fat. Check the ingredient list — milk, cream and an acid (vinegar/lemons) are good; avoid tubs with lots of stabilizers if you want a fresh, natural flavor.",
      "Pick the freshest tub (check use‑by date) and look for moist but not watery curds. A little whey on top is normal; avoid separated, sour, or slimy products. For salads or spreads, seek a small‑batch or artisan ricotta for better flavor."
    ],
    "pairing_tips": [
      "Bright acidic flavors cut the richness: lemon zest, a splash of balsamic, or a squeeze of orange pair beautifully, as do fresh herbs like basil, thyme or mint.",
      "Sweet pairings work well for breakfasts and desserts: drizzle of honey, fresh figs or berries, citrus marmalade or a sprinkle of toasted nuts.",
      "Savory pairings: serve with rustic bread or crostini, roast vegetables, grilled peaches, smoked salmon or cured meats; finish with olive oil, flaky salt and cracked pepper."
    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "To thicken for fillings or spreads, drain ricotta in a cheesecloth‑lined sieve in the fridge for 1–3 hours. For an ultra‑smooth texture, briefly blitz in a food processor with a splash of milk or cream.",
      "Avoid high heat — ricotta becomes grainy if boiled. Fold it into sauces off the heat or warm gently over low heat with reserved pasta water or cream to make a silky sauce.",
      "Make quick homemade ricotta: heat whole milk (or mix milk + cream) to about 180–190°F, add 1–2 tbsp white vinegar or lemon juice per quart of milk, let curds form, then strain in cheesecloth. Drain to desired consistency."

    ],
    "pairing_tips": [
      "Pair with bright, acidic or sweet ingredients that balance its saltiness: watermelon, figs, citrus, honey and ripe pears work especially well.",

    "cooking_tips": [
      "Ricotta salata doesn’t melt — best uses are grating, crumbling or shaving as a finishing cheese to add salty, tangy bite to salads, pasta and roasted veg.",
      "For warm preparations, grill or pan‑sear thick slices to develop a golden crust while keeping shape; it softens but won’t liquefy.",
      "Because it can be quite salty, taste before seasoning other components; if needed, mellow slices briefly in cold water or milk to reduce surface salt, and bring to room temperature before serving for fuller flavor."

    "pairing_tips": [
      "Balance the rice's starch with fattier elements: butter, olive oil, cream, egg yolk or crispy pancetta/bacon round out the mouthfeel and tame starchiness.",
      "Match risotto to seasonal ingredients: spring (asparagus, peas, lemon), summer (tomato, basil), autumn/winter (porcini, mixed mushrooms, squash, truffle) — build the base flavors around them.",
      "Choose wine both for cooking and serving: a dry white (e.g., Pinot Grigio, Soave) for deglazing; serve with a crisp white for seafood/vegetable risottos or a light red (Pinot Noir) for mushroom/meaty versions."
    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "Toast the rice briefly in fat, then deglaze with wine — don't rinse the rice (you want the surface starch). Toasting adds nutty flavor and helps the grains hold shape.",
      "Use hot stock, add it one ladle at a time and keep the pan at a gentle simmer. Stir often but not constantly — consistent gentle agitation helps the rice release starch for creaminess without breaking the grains.",
      "Finish off the heat with a vigorous stir in cold butter and grated Parmesan (mantecatura) to bind the sauce, adjust seasoning, and serve immediately — risotto should be saucy and just al dente."

      "Toast the nuts and char or roast the peppers yourself when possible — that extra caramelization and smoke is what makes romesco stand out.",
      "Warm gently before serving (avoid boiling) and re-emulsify with a little water, extra-virgin olive oil or lemon juice if the sauce separates or is too thick; a quick blitz in a blender brings it back together.",
      "Make ahead — romesco keeps 4–7 days in the fridge and freezes well in portions (ice-cube tray or small containers); bring to room temperature before using so flavors and texture are at their best."

  "root vegetables": {
    "sourcing_tips": [
      "Choose roots that are firm, heavy for their size and free of soft spots, cracks or sprouts — blemishes often mean woody or mealy flesh. Small-to-medium specimens are usually sweeter and less fibrous than oversized ones.",
      "Buy seasonally (many roots peak in late fall through winter) and, when possible, look for roots sold with fresh greens attached — that’s a sign they were recently harvested. Store them in a cool, dark place or the fridge crisper (in a perforated bag) to maintain texture."

    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "Use sparingly — its flavor is powerful. Crumble or shave Roquefort at the end of cooking or fold it into warm (not boiling) cream to make a smooth sauce; high heat can break the texture and make it grainy.",
      "To mellow intensity, blend with cream, mascarpone or softened butter — this yields milder dips, spreads and fillings (stuffed chicken breasts, savory tarts, or pasta sauces).",

  "steak": {
    "sourcing_tips": [
      "Choose the cut to match the method: well-marbled cuts (ribeye, strip) are best for pan-searing or grilling; leaner cuts (flank, skirt, sirloin) are better for marinades and quick high-heat cooks or thin-slicing.",
      "Look for steaks at least 1–1.5 inches thick for an even sear and juiciness; prefer higher grades (USDA Choice/Prime or equivalent) or dry-aged for deeper flavor. Avoid discolored, overly wet, or slimy packages."

    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "Prep and seasoning: pat the steak dry for a good crust. Salt well in advance (about 40 minutes) or just before cooking; add pepper after searing to avoid burnt pepper flavor. Let come close to room temperature for even cooking.",
      "Sear and finish: cook over high heat (cast iron or hot grill) to develop a crust, then finish to temperature. For thick cuts, consider a reverse sear (low, gentle heat first, then a hot sear) for even doneness.",
      "Use an instant-read thermometer and allow for carryover: remove steak about 5°F (≈3°C) below your target. Typical targets — Rare 120–125°F (49–52°C), Medium-rare 130–135°F (54–57°C), Medium 140–145°F (60–63°C). Rest 5–10 minutes and slice across the grain."

      "Balance sweetness with acid and salt: bright acids (lime, lemon, tamarind) and a touch of salt or salty ingredients (soy, fish sauce, aged cheeses) make tropical fruit taste fresher and less cloying.",
      "Use fat and richness to tame sharpness: coconut milk, cream, butter, avocado, yogurt or fatty proteins (pork, duck, grilled fish) round the fruit’s brightness and add mouthfeel.",
      "Contrast with spice and herbs: fresh chilies, ginger, cilantro, mint, basil or warm spices (cinnamon, star anise) create savory-sweet interplay—great in salsas, marinades and chutneys."
    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "Caramelize or grill to deepen flavors: high heat (grill, broil or pan-sear) concentrates sugars and adds savory char. Firm fruits (pineapple, mango, plantain) hold up best to direct heat.",
      "Manage proteolytic enzymes: fresh pineapple and papaya contain enzymes (bromelain, papain) that break down proteins and gelatin. Cook briefly or use canned (enzymes destroyed) when making gelled desserts or long marinades.",
      "Adjust for water content and ripeness: very ripe fruit is best used raw (salsas, salads, smoothies) or quickly macerated with sugar/acid; slightly underripe fruit benefits from cooking down into compotes, sauces or chutneys to concentrate flavor and reduce excess moisture."

      "Bright herbs and acids: dill, parsley, tarragon, chives, lemon or lime juice and capers lift trout’s delicate flavor.",
      "Rich complements: brown butter, crème fraîche, olive oil, or a bit of bacon add mouthfeel and balance the lean flesh.",
      "Textures and sides: toasted nuts (almond, hazelnut), new potatoes, asparagus, grains (quinoa, farro) or quick pickles provide contrast and balance."
    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "Keep the skin on and crisp it: pat fillets dry, score if thick, season, then cook skin-side down in hot oil and press briefly until the skin is crisp before flipping. Remove any pin bones before cooking.",
      "Avoid overcooking: aim for 125–130°F (52–54°C) for medium-rare to medium; trout cooks quickly (roughly 3–5 minutes per side in a pan depending on thickness), and will firm slightly with a short rest.",
      "Simple finishes work best: a squeeze of citrus, a spoonful of brown butter, or a light herb-mustard sauce added just before serving enhances—not overwhelms—the fish."

      "Buy a small, dark glass bottle (protects from light) and check the oil base — extra‑virgin olive oil gives more character, neutral oils (grapeseed) let the truffle note pop. Store in a cool, dark place and use within a few months of opening."
    ],
    "pairing_tips": [
      "Pair with fatty or starchy bases (eggs, mashed or roasted potatoes, buttered pasta, risotto) — their richness carries and softens the truffle aroma.",

    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "Use very sparingly — a few drops to a teaspoon is often enough. Truffle oil is intensely aromatic and can become cloying if overused.",
      "Always add as a finish off the heat (drizzle over plated food or stir in at the end) so the volatile aroma compounds remain intact; do not cook or fry at high heat.",

      "Keep seasonings simple (salt, pepper) and avoid strong herbs or acidic sauces that will overpower the truffle’s perfume."
    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "Use raw or very gently warmed: shave or finely grate truffle over a finished, hot dish so residual heat releases aroma. Thin slices or a microplane/grater preserve perfume better than long cooking.",
      "To spread the aroma through a dish, lightly infuse fats—gently warm truffle slices in butter, cream or oil over low heat for a few minutes rather than boiling; finish the dish with fresh shavings.",
      "Clean and store carefully: brush off debris and rinse briefly only if needed, dry thoroughly. Refrigerate wrapped in paper towel inside an airtight container (change towel daily) and use within a week; for longer storage, freeze in butter or vacuum-seal — texture changes but aroma is retained."

    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "For tuna steaks use very high heat and quick cooking: sear 45–90 seconds per side (depending on thickness) for a warm rare center — tuna is best served rare to medium‑rare to stay tender.",
      "When serving raw or tataki keep the fish ice‑cold, use a very sharp knife and slice against the grain into thin pieces; marinate briefly (30–60 seconds) if using citrus to avoid ‘cooking’ the flesh too long.",

    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "Turbot is meaty and holds together — sear skin-side first in hot oil, finish with butter basting and don’t overcook; aim for an internal temp around 52–56°C (125–133°F) and rest a couple minutes.",
      "Thicker fillets can be started in a hot pan then finished in a 180°C oven for even doneness; whole turbot is excellent roasted or baked en papillote on a bed of aromatics.",

  "vinaigrette": {
    "sourcing_tips": [
      "Choose oils to suit the final flavor: a good extra‑virgin olive oil for classic, grassy vinaigrettes; neutral oils (avocado, grapeseed, light olive) when you want the acid or herbs to shine. Smell oils—rancid oils smell stale or metallic and should be avoided.",
      "Pick the right acid: aged balsamic for sweet/deep dressings, sherry vinegar for savory/umami notes, white or red wine vinegar for bright classics, or fresh citrus for lively, fresher vinaigrettes. Check labels for added sugars or colorings if you want a pure vinegar flavor."
    ],
    "pairing_tips": [
      "Match acid to ingredient: lemon/sherry with seafood, red‑wine or balsamic with roasted vegetables and beef, white wine or champagne vinegar with delicate greens and chicken.",

    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "Emulsify properly: whisk (or use a jar/blender) and add the oil in a slow, steady stream to the acid + emulsifier (Dijon, mustard, egg yolk) to create a stable emulsion. If it breaks, whisk in a teaspoon of warm water or another teaspoon of mustard to bring it back together.",
      "Use a reliable ratio and balance flavors: start with about 3 parts oil to 1 part acid, then taste and adjust—salt early (it rounds acids), add a pinch of sugar or honey if too bright, and finish with fresh herbs or cracked pepper just before serving.",
      "Match temperature and technique to application: for warm dishes, gently warm the oil with garlic or aromatics before whisking with the acid so the vinaigrette melds with roasted vegetables or warm grains. Store refrigerated for up to a week and re‑whisk or shake to recombine before using."

      "Match style to purpose: choose a dry, higher-acid white for savory sauces and fat-cutting, a medium-to-full-bodied red for braises and stews, and buy specific fortified/sweet wines (dry sherry, Marsala, Madeira) for their distinct flavors."
    ],
    "pairing_tips": [
      "Red wines (Cabernet, Syrah, Malbec, or a fuller Pinot) complement red meats, rich stews and tomato-based dishes; lighter reds (Pinot Noir, Gamay) pair well with mushrooms and pork.",
      "Dry whites (Sauvignon Blanc, unoaked Chardonnay, Vermentino) suit fish, shellfish, chicken and cream sauces—use higher-acid whites to cut richness.",
      "Fortified and sweet wines (dry sherry, Marsala, Madeira, late-harvest) add depth to pan sauces, mushroom dishes and many desserts; use sweet wines for poaching fruit."
    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "Add wine early in long braises so flavors integrate and harsh alcohol cooks off; add late for quick pan sauces if you want brighter, aromatic notes.",
      "Reduce wine by simmering to concentrate flavor and mellow acidity—taste as it reduces and stop when the balance suits the dish.",
      "Use wine to deglaze pans and build sauces: pour while hot, scrape browned bits, then combine with stock and finish (butter/cream) for a glossy, rounded sauce. Freeze leftover wine in ice-cube trays for future cooking."

  "wine vinegar": {
    "sourcing_tips": [
      "Choose the style to suit the use: red wine vinegar for hearty, savory dishes; white wine vinegar (or Champagne vinegar) for lighter, delicate flavors. Look for a named varietal or region if you want more complexity.",
      "Check the label for acidity (typically ~5–7%) and consider an unpasteurized/raw bottle with the “mother” if you want rounder, more complex flavor. Avoid very cheap, sharp vinegars that taste metallic or thin."
    ],
    "pairing_tips": [
      "Wine vinegar and olive oil are a classic base for vinaigrettes; add mustard, honey or shallots to balance and emulsify.",
      "Red wine vinegar pairs especially well with roasted or grilled red meats, root vegetables, and beans; white wine vinegar suits seafood, chicken, delicate salads and quick pickles.",
      "Balance its acidity with fats (butter, cream, oil), sweetness (honey, sugar), or savory aromatics (garlic, capers, anchovies, fresh herbs) to round the flavor."
    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "Add wine vinegar near the end of cooking or use as a finishing splash to preserve brightness; if you simmer it for a sauce, do so gently to avoid losing delicate aromatics.",
      "Use it to deglaze a pan — a quick splash will lift browned bits; then finish the sauce with butter or cream to tame sharpness.",
      "Vinaigrette and pickling guidance: vinaigrette ≈ 1 part vinegar to 3 parts oil (adjust to taste). Quick pickles/marinades often use 1 part vinegar to 1 part water plus salt/sugar and aromatics."

  "winter squash": {
    "sourcing_tips": [
      "Choose squash that feels heavy for its size, has a hard, matte (not shiny) rind and an intact stem; avoid soft spots, punctures or moldy areas.",
      "Pick the variety for your use: butternut or Hubbard for soups and purees, kabocha for a sweet, dense texture, delicata or acorn for quick roasting with edible skin. Winter squash is harvested in fall but stores for months—buy ripe, firm examples."
    ],
    "pairing_tips": [
      "Balance the squash's natural sweetness with acids and dairy: lemon, apple cider vinegar, yogurt, crème fraîche or tangy goat cheese brighten the flavor.",
      "Complement with warm spices and aromatics: cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, cumin or curry powder and herbs like sage, rosemary or thyme.",
      "Pair with fatty or savory elements to round the dish: brown butter, olive oil, bacon, sausage, roasted nuts, or beans/lentils for a hearty meal."
    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "Roast at high heat (400–425°F / 200–220°C) after tossing in oil and salt: caramelization concentrates sweetness and adds depth—use uniform pieces for even cooking.",
      "Leave the skin on varieties with thin, tender rinds (delicata, some kabocha) to save time; peel thicker-skinned types (butternut, Hubbard) or roast whole until soft, then scoop.",
      "For silky purees, roast flesh flesh-side-down to dry and intensify flavor, then scoop and blend; reserve and roast the seeds for a crunchy garnish."

  "yams": {
    "sourcing_tips": [
      "Pick yams that are firm, heavy for their size and free of soft spots, cuts or mold; thin, intact skin indicates freshness.",
      "Be aware of labeling: in many U.S. stores “yams” are actually orange-fleshed sweet potatoes. If you need a true starchy African/Caribbean yam, ask the produce clerk or check origin/variety."
    ],
    "pairing_tips": [
      "Sweet pairings: butter, maple syrup, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg or orange/zest — they enhance the natural sweetness.",
      "Savory pairings: smoked paprika, chili, cumin, soy or miso, ginger and lime; pair with pork, bacon, black beans or hearty greens to balance sweetness.",
      "Creamy and tangy: coconut milk, cream, goat or feta cheese and yogurt add richness and contrast; toasted seeds or nuts give crunch."
    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "Roast at high heat (about 425°F / 220°C) for best caramelization and depth of flavor; cut into even pieces, toss with oil and salt before roasting.",
      "For smooth mash, bake whole or steam instead of boiling; if you do boil, use large chunks and drain well, then steam-dry briefly so they don’t become watery.",
      "For crisp fries/chips: soak cut yams in cold water 20–30 minutes to remove surface starch, dry thoroughly, optionally toss with a little cornstarch, then roast or fry at high temperature for a crunchy exterior."

    "sourcing_tips": [
      "Choose plain, unsweetened yogurt for maximum versatility; check the label for live active cultures if you want probiotic benefit.",
      "Pick the style that suits your use: Greek/strained or Skyr for thickness and higher protein, regular yogurt for dressings and baking; check fat and added-sugar content to match flavor/health goals."
    ],
    "pairing_tips": [
      "For savory uses, pair yogurt with bright acids (lemon, vinegar), fresh herbs (mint, dill, cilantro) and garlic or cumin for dips, sauces and marinades.",
      "For sweet applications, combine yogurt with honey, maple, vanilla, fresh fruit, nuts or granola to balance tanginess and add texture.",
      "Use yogurt to mellow spicy or rich dishes — it works well with chiles, curry spices, smoked meats and roasted vegetables to add creaminess and cool heat."
    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "To prevent curdling when heating yogurt, temper it by whisking a small amount of the hot liquid into the yogurt first, then slowly add the warmed yogurt back to the pot; avoid boiling.",
      "Use full‑fat yogurt for cooked sauces, soups and baked goods for creamier texture and more stable results; low‑fat versions can split more easily.",
      "To thicken yogurt for dips or labneh, strain it through cheesecloth or a fine sieve for several hours to remove whey; reserve whey for baking or smoothies."

  "yuzu": {
    "sourcing_tips": [
      "Choose fruit that feels heavy for its size, is firm with fragrant skin and free of soft spots or mold; thin, slightly bumpy rind with bright yellow to greenish tones is ideal.",
      "If fresh yuzu aren't available, use high-quality unsweetened bottled yuzu juice or frozen yuzu (zest or juice). Frozen zest/juice preserves the aroma far better than prolonged refrigerated storage."
    ],
    "pairing_tips": [
      "Pairs beautifully with seafood and soy/miso — use for sashimi, grilled fish, ponzu and miso dressings to lift flavors.",
      "Balances rich, fatty ingredients: butter, cream, avocado, pork and fatty fish — the citrus brightness cuts richness without adding sweetness.",
      "Works with sweet and aromatic partners: honey, white chocolate, matcha, sesame, shiso, and spirits like gin or sake for cocktails and desserts."
    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "Zest before you cut and use a microplane — most of yuzu's character is in the peel; add zest or a splash of juice at the end of cooking to preserve volatile aromatics.",
      "Start with small amounts of juice (it’s intensely floral and tart) and adjust — if too sharp, round it with a little sugar, honey or fat rather than more salt.",
      "Freeze whole fruit or juice in ice-cube trays for later; when grating, keep the fruit cold and avoid scraping into the bitter white pith."

  "zucchini": {
    "sourcing_tips": [
      "Choose small–medium fruit (about 6–8 inches): they’re more tender, less seedy and have better flavor than very large zucchinis.",
      "Pick firm, glossy skin with no soft spots, cuts or shriveling; buy in summer or from local farmers for best price and freshness."
    ],
    "pairing_tips": [
      "Bright flavors and herbs complement zucchini — lemon, garlic, basil, dill, parsley or mint brighten its mild sweetness.",
      "Cheeses and fats work well: Parmesan, feta, goat cheese, mozzarella, olive oil or butter add richness and balance texture.",
      "Zucchini pairs with proteins and starches—grilled fish or chicken, eggs, pasta, rice or polenta for hearty dishes."
    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "If making zoodles, fritters or baked goods, salt grated or sliced zucchini, let sit 10–15 minutes, then squeeze out excess water to avoid sogginess.",
      "Use high heat for best texture and flavor: sauté, grill or roast at ~220°C/425°F to get caramelization; keep cooking time short to prevent mush.",
      "For stuffing or boats, scoop center, mix the removed flesh with fillings (cheese, breadcrumbs, herbs), then roast until just tender and topping is golden."

  "zucchini blossoms": {
    "sourcing_tips": [
      "Buy blossoms as fresh as possible — look for bright, unblemished petals that are still mostly closed and not wilted or slimy. Avoid brown spots or torn petals.",
      "If you have a choice, pick male flowers (long thin stems) for cooking — they’re easier to stuff and won’t remove a future zucchini. Shop farmers’ markets early morning for best freshness; use within 24–48 hours."
    ],
    "pairing_tips": [
      "Mild, creamy cheeses are classic: ricotta, fresh mozzarella, burrata or soft chèvre work especially well for stuffing and balance the delicate flower flavor.",
      "Bright, acidic accents lift rich fillings — lemon zest/juice, a splash of vinegar, or ripe tomatoes cut through the oil/cheese and refresh the dish.",
      "Herbs and complementary textures: basil, mint, parsley or chives for aroma; prosciutto, crispy breadcrumbs or toasted nuts for salt/crunch."
    ],
    "cooking_tips": [
      "Clean gently: open each blossom, remove the stamen (and check for insects), rinse quickly if needed and pat very dry — excess water dilutes batter and makes steaming instead of frying.",
      "For frying, use a light batter (tempura or a thin beer batter) and oil at 350–375°F (175–190°C). Fry briefly until golden and drain well to avoid greasy, soggy results.",
      "When stuffing, don’t overfill — fold the petals or secure with a chive/toothpick so they keep shape. If the filling contains raw ingredients (meat, dense vegetables), cook the filling first; for cheese-only fillings you can bake (about 400°F/200°C) or pan-roast until set and golden."
