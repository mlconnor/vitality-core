  "title": "Chile Tomato Ragout with Toasted Peanuts",
  "description": "Bright, spicy, and deeply aromatic, this Chile Tomato Ragout draws on José Andrés's Spanish-Latin fusion spirit—melding earthy Spanish olive oil with the lively punch of Latin chiles and tomatoes. The ragout is finished with a flourish of toasted peanuts, a nod to both Spanish and Latin American pantry staples, adding depth, crunch, and brain-healthy polyphenols. Fresh herbs and a squeeze of lime keep the flavors high and vibrant, while avocado oil ensures a clean, robust base perfect for high-heat sautéing. Naturally adaptable and rooted in whole ingredients, this dish celebrates the Latin Spice-Bright profile by layering heat, tang, and freshness in every bite.",
