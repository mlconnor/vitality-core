  "title": "French Rustic Allspice Beef Stew with Caramelized Onions",
  "description": "This French Rustic Allspice Beef Stew with Caramelized Onions channels Daniel Boulud’s signature blend of refined technique and deep comfort. Tender beef is gently braised with warming allspice, robust red wine, and antioxidant-rich herbs, all enveloped by a tapestry of slowly caramelized onions. The resulting stew is richly layered, with earthy undertones and a subtle sweetness, capturing the soul of French countryside cuisine. The use of avocado oil supports gentle, high-heat browning, while fresh parsley and thyme introduce vivid polyphenols and brightness. This recipe is comfort-forward, easily adaptable, and crafted to nourish both body and spirit.",

Cover and transfer to a low simmer on stove or in a 325°F (165°C) oven. Stew until beef is fork-tender and flakes easily, onions nearly melt, and broth takes on a silky, rich texture—usually 2.5 to 3 hours.
