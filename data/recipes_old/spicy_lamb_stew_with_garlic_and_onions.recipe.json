  "title": "Spicy Lamb Stew with Garlic and Onions",
  "description": "This aromatic lamb stew channels Yotam Ottolenghi’s vibrant Middle Eastern Mezze style, layering bold Mediterranean flavors with a focus on fresh herbs, warming spices, and whole-food ingredients. Tender lamb simmers with sweet onions, a generous amount of garlic, chili, and a medley of antioxidant-rich herbs. A splash of pomegranate molasses and a finishing drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil add brightness and depth, while smoky paprika and cumin underscore the stew’s earthy, spicy character. The result is a flexible, health-conscious dish that’s deeply savory, satisfying, and perfect for sharing with mezze. Adaptable and forgiving, this stew encourages you to taste, adjust, and let the sensory cues guide you to Mediterranean perfection.",
