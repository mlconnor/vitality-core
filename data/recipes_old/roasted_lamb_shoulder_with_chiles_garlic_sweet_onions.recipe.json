  "title": "Roasted Lamb Shoulder with Chiles, Garlic & Sweet Onions",
  "description": "This Roasted Lamb Shoulder channels Ray Garcia’s Latin American heritage and his bold, Latin Spice-Bright flavor profile: layers of sweet roasted onions, smoky chiles, and deeply aromatic garlic infuse succulent lamb in a style that’s both vibrant and soulful. Avocado oil, fresh herbs, and whole spices offer a lively, health-conscious twist on a celebratory classic, with a focus on adaptability—taste, adjust, and roast to your taste. Polyphenol-rich herbs and antioxidant-laden chiles add both flavor and mind-body benefits, while the technique encourages sensory cooking: watch for golden caramelized edges and fork-tender meat, not just the clock. This dish is designed for festive gatherings and easy sharing.",

Roast in the oven until the lamb is fork-tender and pulls away from the bone easily, with onions deeply caramelized and chiles soft—this can take 2.5–3 hours, depending on your oven and lamb size. Check for tenderness with a fork: if the meat resists, return to the oven, checking every 15–20 minutes.
