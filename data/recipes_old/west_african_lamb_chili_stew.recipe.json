  "title": "West African Lamb Chili Stew",
  "description": "This West African Lamb Chili Stew channels Pierre Thiam’s vibrant, health-forward approach, blending earthy lamb with bitter greens, warming spices, and a hint of chili—the spiced-bitter flavor profile shines through every bite. Featuring antioxidant-rich bitterleaf (or kale), fragrant West African spices, and a coconut oil base, this stew is layered, adaptively spiced, and deeply satisfying. The dish is hearty yet balanced, with a focus on natural ingredients and bold, brain-healthy flavors. Serve with fonio or brown rice for a nourishing meal that’s both traditional and modern.",
