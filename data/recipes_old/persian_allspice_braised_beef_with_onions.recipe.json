  "title": "Persian Allspice-Braised Beef with Onions",
  "description": "This warming Persian Allspice-Braised Beef with Onions is inspired by Najmieh Batmanglij’s signature approach to Persian home cooking: aromatic, layered, and deeply spiced, yet always inviting adaptation. Tender beef is gently braised with sweet onions, earthy allspice, turmeric, and a touch of saffron, creating a stew that’s both comforting and vibrant. The recipe uses avocado oil for its high smoke point and health benefits, while fresh herbs and pomegranate arils (rich in antioxidants) lend brightness and balance to the dish. This entree encapsulates the Middle Eastern spiced profile, blending tradition with thoughtful ingredient choices for a dish that’s as nourishing as it is flavorful.",
