  "title": "Slow-Baked Achiote Pork with Sour Orange & Tomato Relish",
  "description": "This dish embodies Chef Ray Garcia's Latin American Heritage style—layering vibrant, spice-driven flavors with a health-conscious approach. Pork shoulder is gently marinated in achiote and citrus, slow-baked for melting tenderness and deep color, then paired with a bright, antioxidant-rich tomato relish featuring sour orange and fresh herbs. The recipe leans on natural, whole foods and brain-boosting ingredients like fresh herbs, tomatoes, and citrus, using avocado oil for its high smoke point and subtle flavor. Adaptable sensory cues guide each step, inviting you to cook as Ray does: with intuition, curiosity, and respect for tradition.",
