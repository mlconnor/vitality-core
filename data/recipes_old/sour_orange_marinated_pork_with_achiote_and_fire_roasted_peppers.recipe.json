Add pork in a single layer, working in batches if needed to avoid crowding. Sear on all sides until deep golden brown with caramelized edges, 2–4 minutes per side. You should hear an active sizzle and see fond (browned bits) forming. Transfer browned pork to a plate; repeat with remaining pieces, adding oil if needed.
