  "title": "Achiote Pork with Sour Orange and Charred Citrus Salsa",
  "description": "This dish channels Enrique Olvera’s refined yet rustic Mexican regional style, merging earthy achiote-marinated pork with a vibrant, brain-boosting charred citrus salsa. The pork is infused with sour orange and warm spices, then roasted for juicy tenderness, while the salsa layers brightness and antioxidant-rich herbs with smoky, caramelized citrus. True to Olvera’s approach, the recipe honors tradition but encourages adaptability—using sensory cues over rigid timing, integrating healthy whole foods, and inviting you to taste, adjust, and make the dish your own. The 'Latin Spice-Bright' flavor profile shines through zesty acids, savory pork, and charred fruit, balanced by fresh herbs. This is a healthful, celebratory entree to anchor your table, best shared family-style.",
