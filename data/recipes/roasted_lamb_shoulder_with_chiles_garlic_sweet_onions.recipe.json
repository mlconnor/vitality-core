  "title": "Roasted Lamb Shoulder with Chiles, Garlic & Sweet Onions",
  "description": "Bone-in lamb shoulder is rubbed with a vibrant dried-chile and citrus paste, roasted low and slow over sweet onions, and finished with a bright herb-lime salsa. The dish leans into Mexican pantry staples—guajillo and ancho chiles, garlic, and citrus—for a Latin spice-bright profile that’s savory, tangy, and gently smoky. Healthy swaps include extra-virgin olive oil, plenty of onions, and a fresh herb finish to balance richness without heavy dairy.",
