  "title": "Achiote Pork with Sour Orange and Charred Citrus Salsa",
  "description": "Lean pork tenderloin is marinated in a vivid achiote–sour orange recado, then seared and roasted until just rosy and juicy. A charred citrus salsa brings smoky brightness with orange, lime, jalapeño, and cilantro—classic Mexican regional balance of earthy spice and punchy acid. The dish is light yet satisfying, uses whole ingredients, and keeps oil modest for a healthier plate without losing flavor.",

Pour the remaining marinade over the pork, turn to coat, and massage it in so the surface is evenly stained brick-red. Cover and refrigerate 30 minutes up to overnight; rotate once for even contact. For food safety, keep chilled during the soak, and wash hands, board, and tools after handling raw pork. Pull the pork from the fridge 20 minutes before cooking so the chill comes off; surface should feel tacky, not wet.",

Let cool until warm, then chop the citrus segments, catching juices. Mix with onion, jalapeño, cilantro, olive oil, and juice; season with salt.
