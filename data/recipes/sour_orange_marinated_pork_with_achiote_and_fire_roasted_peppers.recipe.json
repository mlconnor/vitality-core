  "title": "Sour Orange Marinated Pork with Achiote and Fire-Roasted Peppers",
  "description": "Lean pork tenderloin gets a vibrant sour orange–achiote marinade that stains the meat a deep brick red and keeps it juicy. Fire-roasted peppers and red onion bring sweet smokiness, while a quick sherry vinegar finish adds the bright, tangy snap common across Spanish–Latin cooking. It’s a fresh, citrus-forward, spice-bright entrée with olive oil, herbs, and plenty of vegetables for a lighter, health-conscious plate.",

Peel off charred skins, remove seeds and cores, and slice peppers into strips; slice onion into thick crescents.
