  "title": "Spicy Lamb Stew with Garlic and Onions",
  "description": "A warming Middle Eastern-style lamb stew layered with garlic, onions, and aromatic spices. The flavors lean Mediterranean: cumin, coriander, paprika, and a touch of cinnamon bloom in olive oil, tomatoes, and pomegranate molasses for depth and gentle sweetness. Chickpeas and fresh herbs add fiber and brightness. Finished with lemon and optional herby yogurt, this dish is bold yet balanced, nourishing, and easy to make with pantry-friendly ingredients.",
